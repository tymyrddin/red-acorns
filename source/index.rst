=================================================

Physical security involves controlling who has physical access to the facility, the servers, network equipment, and
end-user devices. A physical penetration test assesses all physical security controls, including locks, fences,
security guards, cameras, and other security measures. It attempts to bypass the security
controls to gain physical access to restricted areas, identify sensitive data, and gain an entry to a network.
